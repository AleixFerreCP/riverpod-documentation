| AutoDispose             | (nothing like this in Angular) in riverpod all the requests get cached by default. This basically removes it whenever is not needed anymore. Really recommended to add it in all places, except in places that you really want cache. Making requests without `autoDispose` is really expensive in phone RAM. Please, don't misunderstand it as the takeUntil from Angular, this has nothing to do with that. |
