1. **Reduces Boilerplate Code**: Writing immutable classes manually involves a lot of repetitive code. `Freezed` automates this, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.

2. **Improves Code Quality**: By generating consistent and error-free code, `Freezed` improves the overall quality and maintainability of your codebase.

3. **Enhanced Performance**: Immutable data structures can lead to performance improvements in certain scenarios because they avoid unnecessary re-renders and updates in state management systems like Provider or Riverpod.

4. **Simplifies State Management**: With features like `copyWith` and union types, managing complex states becomes easier and more intuitive. This is especially beneficial in applications with complex UI states.

5. **Type Safety**: `Freezed` ensures that data models are type-safe, catching potential errors at compile time rather than runtime, leading to more robust applications.
