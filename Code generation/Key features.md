1. **Immutability**: `Freezed` ensures that once an instance of a class is created, it cannot be modified. This is crucial for avoiding unintended side effects, especially in state management.

2. **Equality and Hashing**: Automatically generates `==` and `hashCode` methods. This is important for comparing instances and using them in collections like sets or maps.

3. **CopyWith Method**: Generates a `copyWith` method that allows creating a new instance with some properties changed, without modifying the original instance. This is useful for managing state changes.

4. **JSON Serialization**: Provides built-in support for JSON serialization and deserialization through the `json_serializable` package. This makes it easier to work with APIs and data persistence.

5. **Union Types and Sealed Classes**: Allows defining union types, enabling more expressive and type-safe code. This is particularly useful for modeling complex state machines and handling different data variations.
